  <p>Systems design a procedure by which we define the architecture of a system to satisfy given requirements. It is a technique by which the required amounts of scalability, reliability, performance and consistency are satisfied in real world
    systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    We discuss how to start with system design and why it is required. The first concept in designing a system is scalability. We discuss the two main approaches to solve this problem: Horizontal scaling and vertical scaling.
    <br>
    <br>
    Horizontal scaling is adding more machines to deal with increasing requirements. These machines handle requests in parallel to improve user experience.
    <br>
    <br>
    Vertical scaling is replacing the current machines with more advanced machines to improve throughput and hence response time. The techniques are used in conjunction in real world systems.
